# GrassScript
GrassScript is an interpreted binary based language that uses instructions to run procedures.

Each instruction is made of 8 chars (bits) that can be v or w (1 or 0). At the end of each instructions there must be W that indicates to the interpreter its the end of an instruction. At the end of the script you can place an V and you can concatenate another GrassScript into it.
